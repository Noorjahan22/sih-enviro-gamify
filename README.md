# \## Problem Statement

# \*\*ID:\*\* 25009  

# \*\*Title:\*\* Gamified Environmental Education Platform for Schools and Colleges  

# 

# Despite the rising urgency of climate change and environmental degradation, environmental education in many Indian schools and colleges remains largely theoretical. Students are often taught textbook-based content with little emphasis on real-world application, local ecological issues, or personal responsibility.

# 

# \## Impact

# Students must be environmentally literate and empowered to take meaningful actions. Interactive, practical learning fosters long-term behavioral change, local involvement, and a ripple effect across families and communities. This aligns with India's SDG goals and NEP 2020's emphasis on experiential learning.

#

# \- Interactive lessons and quizzes

# \- Rewards through digital badges and recognition
